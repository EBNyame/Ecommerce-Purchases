This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that performs a detailed **data analysis on ecommerce purchase behaviour**. The goal is to explore real-world transaction data, uncover patterns in customer purchases, and extract insights using **Python data analysis libraries**.

---

## Project Overview

The **Ecommerce Purchases** notebook analyzes an ecommerce transaction dataset to:
- Understand purchasing behaviour and trends.
- Explore customer demographics and purchase patterns.
- Identify popular product categories and typical purchases prices.
- Demonstrate intermediate-level Python data analysis using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.
  
This project is suitable for learners practicing **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **insight generation with Python** in a Jupyter environmnet.

## What’s Inside the Notebook

The notebook includes:
#### 1. Data Loading & Overview
- Read the ecommerce transactions dataset.
- Initial inspection with head(), info(), and describe().

#### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values and inconsistent formats.
- Convert relevant data types for analysis.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics on purchase prices.
- Insights around purchase frequency, time of day, and customer segments.
- Visualization of spending trends and distribution of transaction values.

#### Visualizations
- Charts and plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn to reveal trends and relationships.

Each step is clearly annotated with Markdown explanations and code comments to make the workflow easy to follow and educational.
